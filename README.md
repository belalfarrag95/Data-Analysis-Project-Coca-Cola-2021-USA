# Data-Analysis-Project-Coca-Cola-2021-USA
In this project, I conducted a sales analysis for Coca-Cola in the United States (2021) using Power BI 📊.
The goal was to extract actionable insights that provide a deeper understanding of the market.
🔹 Total Sales: $9M
 🔹 Profit: $3M
 🔹 Units Sold: 17M
 🔹 Average Operating Margin: 36%
📍 Key Insights:
- New York recorded the highest sales with $582K.
- The West region achieved the top performance across all regions.
- Alabama had the highest operating margin at 39%.
- Sales trends showed peaks in July and December.
The dashboard highlights the power of Power BI through:
 ✅ Dynamic filters (Retailer – Region – City – Invoice Date)
 ✅ Comparison of sales and operating profit by state & region
 ✅ Clear monthly trend visualizations
✨ This project demonstrates how Power BI can transform raw data into valuable insights that drive business decisions.
